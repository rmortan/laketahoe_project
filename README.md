# laketahoe_project turned into Photo_Portfolio


this project actually was an eye opening and insightful one,
NOTE the css is coming along and the html structure is on point
Now that ive got an understanding of what im doing its time to get into my Photography portfolio   CLEAN and very eye pleasing.

decided to add my 2nd gfallery layout as my template for "cannon" pictures
